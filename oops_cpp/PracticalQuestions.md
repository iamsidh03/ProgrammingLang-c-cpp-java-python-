Perfect üëç
You already have the **theory FAQs list** ‚Äî now let‚Äôs shift to **practical / coding problems** that are often asked in **OOP-based Online Assessments (OA) or Interviews in C++**.

Here‚Äôs a curated list:

---

## üîπ **Basic Class & Object Implementation**

1. Implement a class `Rectangle` with methods to calculate **area** and **perimeter**.
2. Implement a class `BankAccount` with methods `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `checkBalance`.
3. Implement a class `Student` with attributes `name`, `rollNumber`, `marks[]` and a method to calculate **average marks**.
4. Design a class `Complex` to represent complex numbers. Overload `+`, `-`, and `*` operators.
5. Implement a `Car` class with attributes `speed`, `fuel`, and methods to `drive` and `refuel`.

## üîπ **Inheritance & Polymorphism**

6. Create a class hierarchy for **Shape ‚Üí Circle, Rectangle, Triangle** with a virtual function `getArea()`.
7. Implement a `Vehicle` base class and derived classes `Car` and `Bike`. Demonstrate runtime polymorphism with `startEngine()`.
8. Create a class `Employee` (base) and `Manager` (derived). Add a method `getSalary()` that behaves differently in base and derived.
9. Implement the **Diamond Problem** and solve it using **virtual inheritance**.
10. Demonstrate **function overriding vs function overloading** using a simple class example.

---

## üîπ **Encapsulation & Abstraction**

11. Implement a class `ATM` that hides PIN details and only exposes `withdraw()` and `checkBalance()`.
12. Create an `Abstract` class `Animal` with a pure virtual function `speak()`. Implement `Dog` and `Cat` classes.
13. Write a program to demonstrate how **encapsulation** is achieved using private data members and public getter/setter functions.

---

## üîπ **Operator Overloading & Special Functions**

14. Implement a `Fraction` class. Overload `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `==` operators.
15. Implement a `String` class with operator overloading for `+` (concatenation) and `==` (comparison).
16. Write a class `Matrix` with operator overloading for matrix addition and multiplication.
17. Implement a **copy constructor** and show difference from assignment operator.
18. Implement **deep copy vs shallow copy** in a class `ArrayWrapper`.

---

## üîπ **Advanced OOP Problems**

19. Implement a `SmartPointer` class (like unique\_ptr) to manage memory safely.
20. Design a class `Logger` as a **singleton** (only one instance).
21. Implement a **file system hierarchy** (Base: FileSystemObject, Derived: File, Folder).
22. Design an `OnlineShoppingCart` system with `Product`, `Cart`, and `Order` classes.
23. Implement a `ShapeFactory` class using **Factory Design Pattern** to create different shapes.
24. Implement a `NotificationSystem` with base class `Notification` and derived classes `Email`, `SMS`, `PushNotification`.
25. Implement a `ChessPiece` hierarchy (`King`, `Queen`, `Rook`, etc.) with a virtual function `validMoves()`.

---

## üîπ **Memory & Special Cases**

26. Write a program to demonstrate **object slicing** in inheritance.
27. Implement a class with a **static data member** (e.g., count number of objects created).
28. Implement a class with a **virtual destructor** and explain why it‚Äôs needed.
29. Create a class `Resource` that demonstrates **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** with file handling.
30. Implement a class with **friend function** to access private data.
